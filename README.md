## Emoji Image Transformer

We all waited for it and now it is possible: transform EVERY image you have in an emoji
representation. You can even choose between currently 5 emojis (more to come).
And transform EVERY image (only png and jpg) in an emoji image. 

You can find it here: https://img.loomaa.de/

Or run it locally on your machine!

The best thing is YOU decide how many emojis you want to be set per row.
